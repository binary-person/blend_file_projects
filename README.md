Hi!

Welcome to my stash of blend files where the Blender renders you see on https://twitter.com/binary_person and https://www.deviantart.com/binary-person are stored here.

I usually try to pack the blend files into filename_packed.blend and also provide the textures unpacked. I also try to provide the README.md with the preview of the project, but sometimes I forget.

Date format is "MM-DD-YYYY" and folder format is "blender\_version/date/artwork\_name"
